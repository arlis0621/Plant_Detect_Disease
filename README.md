# Plant_Detect_Disease
In this project ,we will create a convolutional neural network which will be able to predict whether a plant is suffering from disease


Disclaimer: We will use different layers and hyperparameters for building,training and testing.This classification model we will be using Tensorflow and Keras.


Steps involved:

1.Mounting google drive on colab Notebook
2.Visualising the images that we will be working on
3.Finding out the mean of the dimensions and resizing all images.
4.Checking class imbalance
5.Create model architecture and compile.

Benefits:

Human society needs to increase food production by an estimated 70% by 2050.The widespread distribution of smartphones among crop growers around the world with an expected potential of turning the phone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food.
